	<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;"><h3>Nino, portrayed by Wesley Snipes, was the criminal mastermind of his gang, the Cash Money Brothers. He and his best friend Gee Money dominated the drug trade in Manhattan. He was ruthless and unforgiving, eventually murdering Gee Money for clashing with him. He received his karmic retribution when he was gunned down by a victim's father after being acquited of his crimes. Lil Wayne's "Tha Carter" album series is named after Nino's crack house, The Carter. The building is located on 116th and 7th Avenue.</h3></div>
