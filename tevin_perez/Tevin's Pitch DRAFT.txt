4 years with Red Rabbit, a harlem-based commissary kitchen that distributes healthy meals to students ranging from as early as

parent and student profiles, and production schedules. Following the management and organization of the data received, he personally distributes 
reports imperative for next-day production to the necessary teams within the company. He has helped host educational events that teach students how
to re-create the healthy meals the kitchen creates daily, he's spoken with prospects about company goals, principals, and the direction the company 
is heading.
