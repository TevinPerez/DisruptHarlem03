	<h2>G A N T Z</h2>
	<h4>This website contains two site pages of characters from the manga "GANTZ".</h4>
	<h3>Former childhood friends, separated by time, reunited by death; they come to realize what the world is coming to, and what they have to do about it.</h3>
	<h4>After dying trying to save an old homeless drunk that fell onto train tracks, Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato awake in a lonely locked apartment only housing a large black sphere. They come to find out that everyone that appears in that room has died and that they now belong to a "game" of alien hunt. The sphere then opens, revealing suitcases (with outfits) and weapons, which don't seem to work at the time. They soon realize how important their missions are. </h4>
